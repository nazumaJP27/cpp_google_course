/* Exercise 1: Square 'N Sum.
The integer 36 has a peculiar property:
    It is a perfect square, and is also the sum of the integers from 1 through 8.
    The next such number is 1225 which is 35Â², and the sum of the integers from 1 through 49.
Example run:
---------------------------------------------
The number 41616 is a perfect square.
It is the sum of the integers 1 through 288.
---------------------------------------------
TODO:
Find the next number that is a perfect square and also the sum of a series 1...n. This next number may be greater than 32767.
You may use library functions that you know of, (or mathematical formulas) to make your program run faster. */
